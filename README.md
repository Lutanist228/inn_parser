# mnn_parser
To go on with register of medicines project I needed to parse all the information about International Nonproprietary Name of drugs (https://portal.eaeunion.org/sites/odata/redesign/Pages/InternationalNonProprietaryCodeClassifier.aspx) . So, nmm_parser script saves INP in file.
After mnn_parser's done its work - I can use file mnn_dict_res to create new parser for different registers of medicines.
